# Hand Gesture Recognition

In this project, I created several machine learning models capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images. Then, I developed a simple Python application that exploits an AI model saved in .pkl format. Specifically, the application takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.

The documentation includes:
  - DataTransformation Documentation.html
  - Classification Documentation.html
  - RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf, which contains the slides used to present the project.

application.py contains the application code.

In the "application_video" folder, you can find two demonstrative videos.
