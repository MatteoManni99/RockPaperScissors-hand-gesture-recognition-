# Hand Gesture Recognition
In this project I created several Machine Learning models capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images.
Then I developed a simple application in Python that exploit an AI model extracted in .pkl format.
Specifically, the application takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.

The documentation:
1) DataTransformation Documentation.html
2) Classification Documentation.html

RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf is a file containing the slides used to present the project.

application.py is the application code.

In the application_video folder there are 2 demonstrative videos.
