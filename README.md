# Hand Gesture Recognition
In this project, I developed an application capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images.
Specifically, the application takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.

The documentation:
  1) DataTransformation Documentation.html
  2) Classification Documentation.html
RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf is a file containing the slides used to present the project.__
application.py is the application code, to work it needs the models extracted in pkl.__
In the application_video folder there are 2 demonstrative videos.__
