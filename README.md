# Hand Gesture Recognition

In this project, I created several machine learning models capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images. Then, I developed a simple Python application that exploits an AI model saved in .pkl format. Specifically, the application takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.

The documentation includes:
  - "DataTransformation Documentation.html" exposes all the preprocessing steps, including a form of data augmentation.
  - "Classification Documentation.html" exposes all the tested classification methods and the results obtained with them.
  - "RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf" contains the slides that were used to present the project.

application.py contains the application code.

In the "application_video" folder, you can find two demonstrative videos.
