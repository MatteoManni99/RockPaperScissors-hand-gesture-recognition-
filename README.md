# UNI_DataMiningAndMachineLearning_HandGestureRecognition
In this project, I created an application capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images.
Specifically, I developed an application that takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.

RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf is a file containing the slides used to present the project.
