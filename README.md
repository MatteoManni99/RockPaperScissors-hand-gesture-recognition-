# Hand Gesture Recognition
In this project, I developed an application capable of accurately recognizing gestures for rock, paper, and scissors in images.\n
Specifically, the application takes input from the webcam in real-time and attempts to classify the gesture that the user is performing.\n
The documentation:
1) DataTransformation Documentation.html
2) Classification Documentation.html\n
RockPaperScissors-Presentation.pdf is a file containing the slides used to present the project.\n
application.py is the application code, to work it needs the models extracted in pkl.\n
In the application_video folder there are 2 demonstrative videos.
